PyTorch Scatter Documentation
=============================

This package consists of a small extension library of highly optimized sparse update (scatter) operations for the use in `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`_, which are missing in the main package.
Scatter operations can be roughly described as reduce operations based on a given "group-index" tensor.

All included operations are broadcastable, work on varying data types, and are implemented both for CPU and GPU with corresponding backward implementations.
